# Musify
## Uni Project
### Build information
Needs to be built without sound null safety because of flutter_audio_query
pacakge:
`flutter build apk --release --no-sound-null-safety`
### App Information
You will notice that when you press pause, go to Library, play a song and then
go back to Home the play icon will not have changed its state. I am aware of it but since time is pressing I had to focus on the key features. Another thing that will be added is a highlight color in the Library that indicates the song that is being played.
